# gMapsFun
##About this Repo
This is a google maps example showing some random functions, event listeners and custom markers.
It also show cases some map center function, click functions, and custom styling.
I generated this because alot of the docs on Google Dev sites don't function and i wanted a place 
for people to easily interact with google maps

## Goal os this repo was to show a friend some google maps features.
* Marker on click event will center map
* On click map event will create a Marker at location clicked.
* Show custom Buttons, three are in this example (draw polygon, clear map, custome button)
* Show how to load a custom marker onto Google Maps, can be png or svg

Other examples will come as I need more features

Some exisiting issues the clear maps functions only clears the polygon but doesn't remove it permenantly
clear maps will not clear the custom markers, it will clear the custom marker if the polygon has not been
initiated (something to look into).

Custom Button was put in just to get you started and give you something to add a custom event to or a click event.

# Possible Issues
## How to view the example

These files are set up so that you open the html file manually in the browser and get to play with the different features, it does not incorporate any node modules
and makes use of the google maps API

## I updated the template so that you don't have to apply for your own API key to work with maps.
Leave an issue if you have one that isn't an exisitng known issue. or add to the project. aps.
